Structorian is a tool which lets you describe formats of binary data in a powerful C-like language, and then view or edit the data in a structured view. The process of describing the data format is interactive - you can modify the data structure definitions right as you are viewing the data.

Potential uses of Structorian are reverse-engineering games, network protocols and document file formats. It can be also used as a reference tool when writing code for working with data in known and documented formats.

The main goal of the Structorian project is to be for data what IDA (Interactive Disassembler) is for code.

Structorian is written in C# 2.0 and should run under both Microsoft .NET Framework and Mono.
