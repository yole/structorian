The following attributes are common for all field types:

*tag* = _string_   (default attribute)

    The field tag is its name that is shown to the user. It is shown
    in the field view and in the column captions of the table view.
    For hidden fields, the tag value is ignored. If the tag doesn't
    contain spaces or other characters that require string quoting,
    it can also be used to refer to the field in expressions.
    If the tag is not specified, the default tag "Unknown" is used.

*id* = _string_

    The field ID is used to refer to the field in expressions.
    It should be specified only if the tag contains spaces or other
    characters that require string quoting.

    Example:

{{{
      i32 "BIFF count" [id=BIFFCount];
}}}

*hidden* = 1|0

    Fields that have the `hidden` attribute are not shown to the user.
    This attribute can be used for various marker or offset fields.

    Example:

{{{
      [hidden] str [len=2] PESignature;
      if (PESignature == "PE")
      {
        child PEHeader [offset=NewHdrOffset];
      }
}}}

*readonly* = 1|0

    You can set a `readonly` attribute on a field to disallow editing
    this field. This can be helpful for fields that cannot be changed
    without corrupting the structure of the file, like various offset
    fields.
